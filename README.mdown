# Redis Shelf

A simple rack app to browse redis

## Instructions

First install gems

  # required:
  bundle install

    rackup -s thin

Keys are browsed using "localhost:3000/this/is/a/key", which resolves to the redis key "this:is:a:key"

* nicer interface (html)
* fix issue where webrick uses full request_uri
